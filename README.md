# Beta-Value-Finance
## Main Goal of the Project

*This project aims to get financial and data analysis information on two stock datasets (THYAO and BIST), primarily focusing on calculating beta values and categorizing them. In order to evaluate any particular stock in the market, in our case it was THYAO*

## What is Beta Value?

*Beta is a concept that measures the expected move in a stock relative to movements in the overall market. A beta greater than 1.0 suggests that the stock is more volatile than the broader market, and a beta less than 1.0 indicates a stock with lower volatility.*
